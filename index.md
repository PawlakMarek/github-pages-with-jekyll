# Welcome to my blog

Hi!
My name's Marek and I'm a typical geek.

Recently I decided to refresh (well after so many years it would be actually getting it from the beginning) my knowledge about the web development and I'm gonna track my progress using this blog.

Hopefully I'll have enough time and determination to get through it!
Fingers crossed :)
